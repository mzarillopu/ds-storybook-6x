# Icons

Icons can be used as a way to represent information with a visual image instead of text, usually to convey information
more compactly than it otherwise might be represented or to convey information using common branding or industry
standard iconography.

## Adding Icons

A basic set of icons will be provided, but more icons can be added.  Add your .svg file to the icons directory
and provide the icon a class name in the /src/scss/_icon.scss file.

For the best results, the svg should be square (the same width & height).  It should not matter what the actual
width & height are, but be aware that the image will be scaled up/down based on user need.

To enable flexibility for use in various designs, icons should be a single color (preferably black) or as few colors as possible.

## Scaling icons

Icons will generally take the size of the surrounding text, but can be made larger using the following styles: emc-icon-2x,
emc-icon-3x, emc-icon-5x, emc-icon-7x, emc-icon-9x.

## Implementation Notes

## TODO 

* cannot figure out why icons need -2px vertical alignment to properly align with text
* curate a set of commonly used icons to minimize the need for teams to have to find their own
